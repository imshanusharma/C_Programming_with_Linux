# Solution to the Guess your hat color puzzle

1. The prisoner at the 10th position will count the number of even coloured hats.
2. Suppose there are 4 white hats in front of him.
3. So he will say "White".
4. Suppose he dies, all other prisoners will know that there are still even numbers of white hats present.
5. Now the 9th prisoner will check the number of white hats in front of him.
6. If they are even, he will say "black" otherwise "white".
7. If black, still even white hats present. 8th prisoner will again check number of white hats and will say accordingly.
8  If white, there are now odd number of white hats present, 8th prisoner will check white hats number and say accordingly.
9. In this way the prisoners from 9th to 1st position will be saved.

(9 Prisoners saved!!)

# Mathematical Approach

Code white color hats : +1 (for even)
Code black color hats : -1 (for odd)

Multiplying the will always give either +1 or -1.

(Suppose there are 4 white hats) in front of 10th prisoner.

1.The prisoner at the 10th position will count white hats, so he will say either black and white.
2.The prisoner at 9th position will now calculate the result by multiplying the code associated with each colored hat.
  (for example, if there are 4 white and 4 black are in front of him. So, +1*+1*+1*+1*-1*-1*-1*-1) == -1, So he will say "Black")
3.In this way every other prisoner will calculate and say accordingly and will be saved!
